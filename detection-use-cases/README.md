# Detection Use Cases

This folder contains individual detection use case files for the SOC workflow project.

Each file represents a single detection scenario implemented in the lab, including:

- File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)
- SSH Brute Force Detection
- Network Intrusion Detection using Suricata IDS
- Malware Detection and VirusTotal Integration
- Malicious Command Execution
- RDP Brute Force Detection (Windows)

These files demonstrate detection, alert generation, and monitoring capabilities in a simulated SOC environment.
